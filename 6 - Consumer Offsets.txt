[Consumer Offset]:

Messages that's produced into the topic will have a Unique ID called "Offset".

Consumers have three options to read:
1. from-beginning -> Read messages from the beginning
2. latest -> Read only the messages that's going to come after the Consumers spun up.
3. specific offset -> Read the messages and the topic by passing a specific offset value from the consumer.

Consumer Offset in general are stored in an internal topic called "__consumer_offsets". Consumer Offsets helps the consumer to re-read the messages that are produced when consumer was down.

Consumer Offsets behaves like a bookmark for the consumer to start reading the messages from the point it left off.
